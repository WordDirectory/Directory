# Word Directory

## Introduction

Words explained like a human would

This is basically a site to find definitions of words, but they're actually readable.

You know when you look up on Google "[word] definition" and it throws around a bunch of other buzzwords that nobody ever uses so you have to look at the definition of other words to get the definition of the original word?

It's a fucking mess.

(If you're born in the US, you probably don't have this problem lol)

This app solves that by giving you human readable definitions that actually make sense.

Instead of:
- ❌ "Hello is when you greet someone" (if they don't know hello, what's the fucking chance they know greet?)

We do:
- ✅ "Hello is basically when you meet someone and you want to let them know you see them or want to talk to them"

Like, we actually explain what the word is.
