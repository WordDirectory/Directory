# Word Directory

Introducing an innovative, enterprise-grade linguistic comprehension platform leveraging cutting-edge...

Just kidding.

Words explained simply, because fuck complex definitions.

## What's the problem?

You know when you look up on Google "[word] definition" and it throws around a bunch of other buzzwords that nobody ever uses so you have to look up the definition of other words to get the definition of the original word?

It's a fucking mess.

(If you're born in the US, you probably don't have this problem lol)

## Our solution

We explain words how you'd explain them to a friend. No bullshit, no complex terms, just straight-up human explanations.

Instead of:

- ❌ "Hello is when you greet someone" (if they don't know hello, what's the fucking chance they know greet?)

We do:

- ✅ "Hello is basically when you meet someone and you want to let them know you see them or want to talk to them"

## What words do we include?

We focus on words that people actually need explained:

- Everyday words that might confuse non-native speakers
- Slang and internet terms ("yeet", "sus", "fomo")
- Complex words explained simply ("gaslighting", "procrastinate")
- Words with multiple meanings that need context
- Even "inappropriate" words - we don't censor. If people use it, we explain it

We don't waste time on:

- Names of people or places (that's what Google Maps is for)
- Brand names (just Google it)
- Super technical terms only specialists use (like very technical)
