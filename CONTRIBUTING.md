# Contributing to Auth Starterpack

First off, you're awesome for wanting to contribute! üéâ

## Important notice - 27th December 2024

Hey there! Quick heads up - we're in the middle of some intense authentication work. Like, really deep into the security stuff. To keep things safe and avoid any wasted effort, here's what's happening:

### Currently off-limits
I'm heads down working on:
- Core authentication flow
- Security implementation
- Critical auth decisions

Why? Because these parts are getting major updates and I don't want you working on code that'll be outdated in a few days anyways.

### What you can help with right now
There's still plenty of awesome stuff to work on:
- Documentation improvements (always needed!)
- UI improvements
- Finding bugs
- Anything that doesn't touch the core auth functionality

This is temporary - once the core security work is solid, everything opens back up. Thanks for understanding! üôè

This isn't just another auth project. We're building the Shadcn UI of authentication - fully customizable code that developers actually own and can build on. No more being locked into specific ways of doing things.

### 3. Found a bug?
Here's how to report it:
1. Check if someone already reported it in [Issues](https://github.com/mazeincoding/Auth-Starter)
2. If not, create a new one with:
   - How to make the bug happen
   - What should happen
   - What actually happens
   - Screenshots if you can
   - Your browser (Chrome, Safari, etc)

## Want to contribute code?

1. Fork the repo
2. Create your feature branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/awesome-feature
   ```
3. Make your changes
4. Test everything works
5. Push to your fork
6. Open a Pull Request

## Pull Request Tips

Keep these in mind:
- Focus on one thing at a time
- Follow the existing style
- Update docs if needed
- Explain your changes clearly

## What this project is about

Think of this as the authentication foundation that developers can actually build on. Just like how Shadcn UI revolutionized UI components by making them customizable, we're doing the same for auth.

We focus purely on authentication. That means:
- ‚úÖ Email verification
- ‚úÖ Device management
- ‚úÖ Security alerts
- ‚úÖ Basic user settings (email, password, name)
- ‚ùå In-app notifications (not auth-related)
- ‚ùå User profiles (usernames, bios, profile pages, etc)

This keeps the project focused while giving developers a solid foundation they can extend.

We also like simple solutions. That way, the project is easier to pick up on.

## Be awesome to each other

A few ground rules:
- Be kind and helpful
- Focus on solutions, not blame
- Welcome newcomers
- Share knowledge

Let's make authentication great again!
