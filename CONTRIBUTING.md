# Contributing to Auth Starterpack

First off, you're awesome for wanting to contribute! üéâ

This isn't just another auth project. We're building the Shadcn UI of authentication - fully customizable code that developers actually own and can build on. No more being locked into specific ways of doing things.

## What can you help with?

### 1. Add more sign-in methods
Right now we have:
- Email/password
- Google

But there's so much more we could add:
- GitHub (developers would love this)
- Apple (crucial for iOS apps)
- Microsoft (perfect for enterprise)
- Twitter/X (great for social apps)

### 2. Make it even more secure
Security is never "done". Here are some ideas:
- Add authenticator app support for 2FA
- Implement biometric authentication
- Add more security checks during sign-in

### 3. Found a bug?
Here's how to report it:
1. Check if someone already reported it in [Issues](https://github.com/mazeincoding/Auth-Starter)
2. If not, create a new one with:
   - How to make the bug happen
   - What should happen
   - What actually happens
   - Screenshots if you can
   - Your browser (Chrome, Safari, etc)

### 4. Make the docs even better
The goal is to have docs that developers actually enjoy reading:
- Add video demos (seeing is believing)
- Explain how things work under the hood
- Share tips and tricks for customization

## Want to contribute code?

1. Fork the repo
2. Create your feature branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/awesome-feature
   ```
3. Make your changes
4. Test everything works
5. Push to your fork
6. Open a Pull Request

## Pull Request Tips

Keep these in mind:
- Focus on one thing at a time
- Follow the existing style
- Update docs if needed
- Explain your changes clearly

- Open a GitHub issue
- Email me at support@mazewinther.com

## What this project is about

Think of this as the authentication foundation that developers can actually build on. Just like how Shadcn UI revolutionized UI components by making them customizable, we're doing the same for auth.

We focus purely on authentication. That means:
- ‚úÖ Email verification
- ‚úÖ Device management
- ‚úÖ Security alerts
- ‚úÖ Basic user settings (email, password, name)
- ‚ùå In-app notifications (not auth-related)
- ‚ùå User profiles (usernames, bios, profile pages, etc)

This keeps the project focused while giving developers a solid foundation they can extend.

## Be awesome to each other

A few ground rules:
- Be kind and helpful
- Focus on solutions, not blame
- Welcome newcomers
- Share knowledge

Let's make authentication great again!
