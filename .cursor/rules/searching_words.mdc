You must not read the full `src/data/words.ts` file as it can get extremely long! Grep the codebase for the specific word instead.

Grep the word by EXACTLY: "absolutely: {". This exact structure will fetch words properly. Do not add escape characters or anything.

## Searching multiple words

IMPORTANT: If searching for multiple words, you MUST search for each word one by one.
