# Word Directory

Words explained simply, because fuck complex definitions.

## What's the problem?

You know when you look up on Google "[word] definition" and it throws around a bunch of other buzzwords that nobody ever uses so you have to look up the definition of other words to get the definition of the original word?

It's a fucking mess.

(If you're born in the US, you probably don't have this problem lol)

## Our solution

We explain words how you'd explain them to a friend. No bullshit, no complex terms, just straight-up human explanations.

Instead of:
- ❌ "Hello is when you greet someone" (if they don't know hello, what's the fucking chance they know greet?)

We do:
- ✅ "Hello is basically when you meet someone and you want to let them know you see them or want to talk to them"

## Features
