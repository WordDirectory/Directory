### 1.What's the point of email login alerts?
An unknown device logging in to an account will need to verify:
- with a code sent to an email
- or 2FA if user enabled it

Either way, some verification is needed.

If they get through that, then what the fuck is the point of the login alerts?

### 2.Questions about 2FA and device verification
So the idea at first was:
1. Unknown device logs in
2. Needs to verify it through email

But, what if the user has 2FA enabled?
- Will they need to verify with email AND 2FA?
- Or just 2FA?

How do we even define 2FA?
- Is email verification 2FA?
- Will disabling 2FA also get rid of device verification?
- Does login alerts make more sense here?
