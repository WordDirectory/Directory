You must not read the full `src/data/words.ts` file as it can get extremely long! Grep the codebase for the specific word instead.

## Single Word Search
When searching for a single word, use this exact pattern:
```
word: {
```

For example, to search for "absolutely", use:
```
absolutely: {
```

## Searching Multiple Words
When searching for multiple words, combine them with the OR operator (|) in a single grep search. Use this exact pattern:
```
word1: \{|word2: \{|word3: \{
```

For example, to search for "lit", "mood", "salty", and "tea" at once:
```
lit: \{|mood: \{|salty: \{|tea: \{
```

## Important Notes
1. Do NOT add any extra escape characters
2. The space after the colon is required
3. The curly brace is required
4. Keep the pattern exact - don't add any extra characters or spaces
5. For multiple words, always use the | (pipe) operator to separate them
