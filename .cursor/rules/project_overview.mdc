# Word Directory (worddirectory.app)

Words explained simply

Because looking up one word shouldn't mean looking up five more. This app words how you'd explain them to a friend.

It's like any other definition site - but with human readable definitions.

## Structure
- `src/data/words.ts` (all word definitions are stored here)
- `src/app` (Next.js app)
- `src/lib/utils.ts` (all utilities)
- `src/types` (types)
  - `word.ts` (word-related types)

## Tech stack

The project uses:
- Next.js 15
- Shadcn UI
- Tailwind CSS
- TypeScript
