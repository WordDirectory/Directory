# WordDirectory

Words explained simply

Because looking up one word shouldn't mean looking up five more. This app words how you'd explain them to a friend.

It's like any other definition site - but with human readable definitions.

## Tech stack

The project uses:
- Next.js 15
- Shadcn UI
- Tailwind CSS
- TypeScript

## Web app (apps/web)

This is the main site where users can find word definitions.

Live at: https://worddirectory.app

## Chrome extension (apps/extension)

This is a Chrome extension that makes it easier to find definitions (and more conveniently).

Some cool features:
- Highlight a word on any web page, right-click and get the definition of it
- Search "[word] definition" and it'll take the user to the word's definition on the site
